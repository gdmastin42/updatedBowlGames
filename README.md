- This is just a fun website for use in my family. It is only meant for personal use.
- Predictions can be submitted only once per user.
- Login session is stored in localStorage.
- Leaderboard ranks users by number of correct predictions.
- Results are automatically computed from actual scores.
- The User with the username "garrett_mastin" is the "admin" this is a unsecure solution and the only benifit the "admin" has is they can see a button that does a curl to refresh the games scores incase of failure of auto refresh.
